# bga-ganzschonclever

An adaptation of [Ganz Schön Clever](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244522/s-pretty-clever) (That's Pretty Clever!) for [Board Game Arena](https://boardgamearena.com). Game designed by **Wolfgang Warsch** and published by **Schmidt Spiele**

Currently a work-in-progress & being used as a ramp for myself to become familiar with the Board Game Arena development environment.

A license has not been obtained from Schmidt Spiele for this project and it's assets. This is project is just in development. No real assets are being used, placeholder assets used are referenced in `img/notes.txt` but not included in this repository.

### Notes
* Have been approaching to get the _core_ ruleset for Ganz Schön Clever implemented first before adding in all the complexities. Currently excluding:
  * Earning / use of additional player actions (re-rolling & extra die selection)
  * Score sheet marking bonuses
  * End-of-game foxes scoring bonus
  * Solo game mode
* Have opted to keep styling consitent with original template provided by BGA
* Game logic is getting cumbersome already - can see need to extract the concepts of dice management/a player's scoresheet shortly
