# bga-ganzschonclever

An adaptation of [Ganz Sch√∂n Clever](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244522/s-pretty-clever) (That's Pretty Clever!) for [Board Game Arena](https://boardgamearena.com). Game designed by **Wolfgang Warsch** and published by **Schmidt Spiele**

Currently a work-in-progress & being used as a ramp for myself to become familiar with the Board Game Arena development environment.

A license has not been obtained from Schmidt Spiele for this project and it's assets. This is project is just in development. No real assets are being used, placeholder assets used are referenced in `img/notes.txt` but not included in this repository.
